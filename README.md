This project analyzes student migration trends for higher education across various countries.
Key performance indicators (KPIs) were explored to derive insights into student mobility patterns.
The analysis includes SQL queries for data processing and Power BI dashboards for visualization.
I have attached the PPT file, which contains all dashboard details and the SQL codes used in this project.
